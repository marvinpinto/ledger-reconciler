<h2 class="content-subhead">Supported financial institutions</h2>

Ledger Reconciler currently supports the following financial institutions:

- [American Express][amex-plugin]
- [Chase Canada][chase-canada-plugin]
- [Tangerine Bank][tangerine-plugin]
- [Prestocard][prestocard-plugin]


<h2 class="content-subhead">Don't see your financial institution?</h2>

If you would like ledger-reconciler to support an institution not on the list
above, you have the option of either creating the new plugin yourself or asking
for help from the community. The latter can be done by [creating a GitHub
issue][ledger-reconciler-issues].
